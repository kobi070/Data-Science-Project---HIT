Final Data Science Project 


Subject: prediciton is an anime going to be succesful? (calculated by member amount and score)
Language: Python 100%
libraries:Pandas,Numpy,Seaborn,Matplotlib,Yellowbrick for Sklearn,Sklearn,BeautifulSoup,Selenium



Data collection:
Data was collected by crawling using BuatifulSuop and Selenium.
The data frame has 6919 rows × 10 columns, and has the following columns: 

Data cleaning:
Taking care of NaN values
Adjusting value type (for example: members vote from string to int for future use)
Categorizing 

Data Vizualization:


Machine Learning:
Tried 5 different ML algorithms - KNN, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Random Forrest.
Random Forrest had overfitting, Linear Regression wasnt effective
Logistic Regression was chosen with 0.89 accuracy


# Anime Success Predictor
This is the final project of a Data Science course, which aims to predict whether an anime will be successful or not based on its members count and score. The project is written in Python, using a variety of libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Yellowbrick for Scikit-learn, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium.

## Data Collection
We collected data by crawling anime websites using BeautifulSoup and Selenium. The resulting dataset has 6919 rows and 10 columns, including features such as the anime's title, members count, score, genre, and more.

## Data Cleaning
We performed several cleaning steps to prepare the dataset for analysis. We took care of NaN values, adjusted value types (e.g., converting members count from string to integer), and categorized the data based on genre and other features.

## Data Visualization
We used various visualization techniques to explore the dataset and identify patterns and correlations. Some of the visualizations we created include histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

## Machine Learning
We trained several machine learning models on the dataset and evaluated their performance using cross-validation. We tried five different algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. We found that Random Forest overfitted the data, and Linear Regression was not effective. Ultimately, we selected Logistic Regression as our final model, which achieved an accuracy of 0.89.

## Conclusion
Overall, this project shows that it is possible to predict the success of an anime based on its members count and score, using machine learning techniques. We hope this project will be useful to anime fans, producers, and researchers who are interested in understanding the factors that contribute to anime success.
